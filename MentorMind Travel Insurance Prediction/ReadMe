Company: MentorMind, co-certified by Toffee (Jan 2024 - Feb 2024):

Objective: Created a machine learning model to predict if a customer would be interested in taking up travel insurance.
Key Steps: Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, 
and Random Forests are then employed to develop predictive models.
These models are evaluated for performance using metrics like accuracy and f1 score.

Output: A robust model capable of predicting customer purchase of travel insurance with high accuracy, 
and effective in identifying potential insurance buyers.
